# Rat Maze
## Explanation 
In this problem we are given a matrix of
n×n where the matrix cells are marked as
1 (which is a valid path) and 0 (which is
a invalid path) we need to find all the possible 
paths starting from (0,0) to the bottom right 
cell  ( n-1 , n-1 ) . Print path as a string
of move 'U' (UP) , 'D' (DOWN) , 'L' (LEFT)
, 'R'(RIGHT).
